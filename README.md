# Master-Thesis
This repositery contains the data and code for the extraction of metadata using the RB-REGX technique from the 1971 volume of the Brinkman catalogue of books. The extracted data from the other volumes is also available.

This repository was created as a part of an internship at KB by Karen Goes (VU Amsterdam). The accompanying master thesis can be found in this repo as well.
